# Angular-Finance-Tracker-
1. Income Tracking: Implement a user interface that allows users to input and
persist their income.
2. Expense Tracking: Implement a user interface that allows users to input and
persist their expenses.
3. Expense List: Display a list of all entered expenses.
4. Balance Calculation: Calculate and display the user&#39;s balance, defined as total
income minus total expenses. This balance can be negative.
5. Currency Conversion: Provide the ability to convert the balance into at least
two different currencies using a public API, such as freecurrencyapi.com or
currencyfreaks.com. Note: The conversion should not be a simple
multiplication of todayâ€™s exchange rate.
6. State Management: You are free to choose any state management solution,
but please consider scalability for future growth.
7. Local Data Persistence: Ensure the app uses a local database for persisting
data.
